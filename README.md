Case given by Ardoq for summer internship:

"
Hi!

Before we move into interviews we have a couple of technical tasks we'd like you to look at. The first task is mandatory, but you can choose either one of 2 or 3. I hope you find it interesting and fun challenge and get back to me with your answers soon.

1: Create a function that, given a list of integers, returns the highest product between three of those numbers. For example, given the list [1, 10, 2, 6, 5, 3] the highest product would be 10 * 6 * 5 = 300

2: Oslo city bikes has an open API showing real-time data on location and state of the bike stations.
Your task is to create a small application that utilizes this api to show the stations and the amount of available bikes and free spots a station currently has. You’re free to choose which language and libraries you use. How you show the stations and status is also up to you.
The api can be found at  [https://oslobysykkel.no/apne-d…](https://oslobysykkel.no/apne-data/sanntid) 

3: Oslo city bikes have an open API with historical data.
Your task is to create a project and use this data and provide some interesting findings. This can be anything from data preprocessing, data analysis, data visualizations, or applying machine learning in any way you see fit. The most important is that you have a story to tell with the data.
The API can be found at  [https://oslobysykkel.no/apne-d…](https://oslobysykkel.no/apne-data/historisk) 

We prefer if you deliver the task as an open GitHub repo and just send us the link.
"

I went onto solve task 1 and task 2.

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org)
* [Android Studios](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [Google Maps SDK Android](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/overview)
* [Oslo bysykkel API](https://oslobysykkel.no/apne-data/sanntid)


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### USE

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
```
2. Follow Prerequisites instructions
3. When using Android Studios
```sh
Under build, clean and rebuild project before running Android app
```

### Prerequisites

Programs and packages you will need
* IDE
```sh
e.g. Microsoft Visual Studio
```
* Python
```sh
1. For running task1.py and task2.py
2. Follow instructions at python.org regarding installation
```
* Android Studios
```sh
Download android studios to run Android app
```

## Procedure

Used the API from Oslo bysykkel to show locations with data that was required by Ardoq. Additionally used Google Maps SDK and API key for the use of google maps. Initially I used python to handle the API, and visualised in terminal but was not satisfied so swithed over to Android for better visuals.
